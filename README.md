👋 Hello, I’m @JBrocklyAnderson! I'm a recent UC Davis graduate with a B.A. in Political Science and a minor in Mandarin Chinese. I am unconditionally fascinated by almost any subject: politics, language, philosophy, AI, astronomy, interspecies communication, music, nature, you name it (in no particularly order)! The world is full of astonishing things to learn and I'm a little salty there's not enough time in one life to explore it all! 

🌱 I’ve just completed professional certification in Data Analytics which can be verified through my LinkedIn profile. I have experience using R, SQL, and spreadsheets, am currently deep-diving into Python, exploring new projects, and preparing to wrestle with predictive analytics and natural language processing.  

💞️ I’m looking forward to explore what GitHub has to offer and ways of collaborating on projects that make a positive difference in people's lives or marked leaps of progress for the human species and the biosphere we come from.
