👋 Hello, I’m @JBrocklyAnderson! I am unconditionally fascinated by almost any subject: politics, language, philosophy, AI, astronomy, interspecies communication, music, nature, you name it (in no particularly order)! The world is full of astonishing things to learn and I'm a little salty there's not enough time in one life to explore it all! 

🎓🏆💼 I have extensive in-depth academic training about global interdependence and international relations, comprehensive certifications in data analysis, leadership, and cultural sensitivity, professional publications for academic dissertations, deep multilingual capacities in Chinese, French, and Spanish, specialized public-facing customer service experience, an abundant long-standing passion for pharmacology, medicine, and chemistry, and awards for academic excellence from University of California, Davis. 

🌱 I have experience using R, SQL, spreadsheets, mark down, YAML, BibTex, LaTeX, HTML, CSS, and am currently deep-diving into Python on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/@JosephBrockly-A), exploring new projects, and preparing to wrestle with predictive analytics and natural language processing.  

💞️ I’m looking forward to explore what GitHub has to offer and ways of collaborating on projects that make a positive difference in people's lives or marked leaps of progress for the human species and the biosphere we come from.
